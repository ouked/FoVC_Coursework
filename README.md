## Learning outcomes

From the specification:
Construct appropriate mathematical operations to manipulate 3D objects

‚Ä¢ Use an industry standard graphics programming API (ThreeJS)

‚Ä¢ Develop code to interact with JavaScript events (mouse clicks, key presses etc.)

‚Ä¢ Test and document a graphics interaction system

This project has also lead me to learn how **orbiting cameras** work, as we weren't allowed to use the provided OrbitCamera.js module from ThreeJS.
